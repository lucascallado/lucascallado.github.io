Abstract:

This paper clarifies what steganography is and what it can do. Then, it explains how the Least Significant Bit (LSB) concept works. It also describes algorithms implemented by diit to embed messages into 24-bit image files. Finally, it goes over the steganalysis methodology.

General Terms:

Steganography, Steganalysis, Image processing, Security, Steganography Applications and Tools.

Keywords:

Steganography algorithms, Embedding capacity or rate, LSB embedding, Data hiding, Image filtering, RS analysis.
